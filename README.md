# Data-Science-Blog-Post-Udacity
This repository contains the code to one of the projects of udacity data science nano degree projects.

## Dataset
The dataset that was used is the Global emissions from agriculture and forest land gotten from kaggle, you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ankitpranay/global-emissions-from-agriculture-and-forest-land).

## Project Motivation
This is a udacity data science nano degree project, I chose to analyse the global emission dataset.The following question will be answered.
The following questions will be answered:
1. How has the amount of emitted elements varied over the years?
2. Which country has the highest amount of emission over the years?
3. What element is emitted the most?
4. What item or process produced the most emission over the years?

## Project Files
The files needed for this analysis include:
1. global_emission.ipynb - This is the notebook that contains the analysis for the project
2. FAOSTAT_data_1961_2019.csv - This is the dataset that was used for the analysis

## Libraries Used
1. Pandas - This was used for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset
2. Numpy - This was used for performing numerical computations on the dataset
3. Matplotlib - this was used for making plots

## Results and Finding
The result and findings can be found in my blog post [here](https://medium.com/@shahadalanazi/write-a-datascience-blog-post-94ae43da6fb6)
